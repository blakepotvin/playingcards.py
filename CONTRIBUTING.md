# Contributing to playingcards.py
First of all, I would like to say thank you for contributing to this project! This is my first open-source project that was started as a project in high school. My goal is to have a library that can be used by anyone to create their own card games. But in order to reach this goal, I need you! The community is the backbone to any open-source project that is needed to reach this goal. 


## What You Can Help With
- Reporting a bug 🐛
- Discussing the current state of the code 🗣
- Submitting a fix 🛠
- Proposing new features 🚀
- Becoming a maintainer 💪

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/Prodxgy/playingcards.py/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Prodxgy/playingcards.py/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
It is preferred to use autopep8 to format your code. This will ensure that your code is consistent and easy to read. [Deepsource.io](https://deepsource.io) will automatically run checks to ensure that your code is formatted correctly.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
